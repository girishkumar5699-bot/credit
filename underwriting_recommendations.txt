1) Flag applicants with CreditScore < 600 for manual review — SHAP shows this is the strongest risk driver.
2) Limit LoanAmount-to-Income ratios above 50% — SHAP reveals high loan burden increases default risk.
3) Prioritize stable employment history — SHAP shows short or unstable employment contributes to risk.
