Global SHAP summary — top 5 features and interpretation:
1. num__employment_length_years: mean(|SHAP|)=1.2660 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
2. num__num_open_accounts: mean(|SHAP|)=1.0270 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
3. num__loan_term_months: mean(|SHAP|)=0.5514 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
4. num__age: mean(|SHAP|)=0.2536 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.
5. num__loan_amount: mean(|SHAP|)=0.1621 — higher absolute SHAP means larger impact on the model output.

Local case studies (plain-language):

Case: true_positive (test index 10)
Model predicted probability of default = 0.639; predicted label = 1; true label = 1
Top drivers:
 - num__debt_to_income => increases probability by SHAP 3.3401
 - num__employment_length_years => decreases probability by SHAP -1.3473
 - num__age => decreases probability by SHAP -0.7677
 - num__num_open_accounts => decreases probability by SHAP -0.6939
 - num__loan_term_months => decreases probability by SHAP -0.3976
 - num__loan_amount => decreases probability by SHAP -0.3683
 - num__income => decreases probability by SHAP -0.1391
 - cat__home_ownership_RENT => decreases probability by SHAP -0.0892
